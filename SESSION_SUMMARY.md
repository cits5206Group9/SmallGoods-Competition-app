# Session Summary - Technical Violations & Athlete Filter Features

## Date: 7 October 2025

## Overview
This session involved implementing two major features:
1. **Technical Violations Tracking** - Allow referees to specify violations when casting decisions
2. **Athlete Name Filtering** - Add athlete name filter to Decision Results page

---

## Feature 1: Technical Violations Tracking

### Problem Statement
Referees needed a way to document specific technical violations (Press Out, Elbow Touch, etc.) when casting "No Lift" decisions, with violations stored in the database and displayed in Decision Results.

### Solution Implemented
Created an always-visible violations section below decision buttons where referees can select violations before submitting their decision.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema (`migrations/versions/0b6ea5018ef6_*.py`)
**Added violations field to RefereeDecisionLog table:**
```python
op.add_column('referee_decision_log', 
    sa.Column('violations', sa.Text(), nullable=True))
```

#### 2. Model Updates (`app/models.py`)
**Added violations field:**
```python
class RefereeDecisionLog(db.Model):
    violations = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)  # Comma-separated violations
    
    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            # ... other fields ...
            'violations': self.violations,
        }
```

#### 3. Backend API (`app/routes/admin.py`)

**Submit Decision - Accepts violations array:**
```python
@admin_bp.route('/api/referee-decision', methods=['POST'])
def submit_referee_decision():
    # Get violations if provided
    violations = data.get('violations', [])
    violations_str = ', '.join(violations) if violations else None
    
    new_decision = RefereeDecisionLog(
        # ... other fields ...
        violations=violations_str,
    )
```

**Update Decision - Updates violations field:**
```python
@admin_bp.route('/api/decision-results/<int:decision_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_decision_result(decision_id):
    if 'violations' in data:
        decision.violations = data['violations']
```

#### 4. Individual Referee Page (`app/templates/admin/individual_referee.html`)

**HTML - Always-visible violations section:**
```html
<div class="violations-section show" id="violations-section">
    <h4>Technical Violations (Optional)</h4>
    <p>Select applicable violations (if any), then click your decision above</p>
    
    <div class="violations-grid">
        <div class="violation-checkbox">
            <input type="checkbox" id="violation-press-out" value="Press Out">
            <label for="violation-press-out">Press Out</label>
        </div>
        <!-- 7 more checkboxes for other violations -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**CSS - Styled violations section:**
```css
.violations-section {
    display: none;
    background: #fff3cd;
    border: 2px solid #ffc107;
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-top: 20px;
}

.violations-section.show {
    display: block;
}

.violations-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 10px;
}
```

**JavaScript - Collect violations on submit:**
```javascript
async castDecision(decisionOption) {
    // Collect selected violations from checkboxes
    const violations = [];
    document.querySelectorAll('.violations-section input[type="checkbox"]:checked')
        .forEach(checkbox => {
            violations.push(checkbox.value);
        });
    
    console.log('Submitting decision:', decisionOption.label, 'with violations:', violations);
    
    const response = await fetch('/admin/api/referee-decision', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            // ... other fields ...
            violations: violations,
        })
    });
}
```

#### 5. Decision Results Page (`app/templates/admin/referee_decisions.html`)

**Added Violations column to table:**
```html
<th>VIOLATIONS</th>
<!-- ... -->
<td>${decision.violations || '-'}</td>
```

**Added violations field to edit modal:**
```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="edit-violations">Violations (comma-separated)</label>
    <input type="text" id="edit-violations" 
           placeholder="e.g., Press Out, Knee Touch">
    <small>Enter violations separated by commas for "No Lift" decisions</small>
</div>
```

**JavaScript - Handle violations in edit:**
```javascript
async showEditModal(decisionId) {
    document.getElementById('edit-violations').value = decision.violations || '';
}

async saveDecisionEdit(e) {
    violations: document.getElementById('edit-violations').value,
}
```

### Available Violations
1. Press Out
2. Elbow Touch
3. Knee Touch
4. Bar Pressed Down
5. Incomplete Lockout
6. Foot Movement
7. Early Drop
8. Other Technical

### User Workflow
```
Referee Page:
1. Check violations (optional) ☑
2. Click decision button (0-5) 
3. Decision submits with violations ✅

Decision Results Page:
1. View violations in table column
2. Edit violations via modal
3. Violations display as comma-separated list
```

### Key Bug Fixes During Implementation
1. **Issue:** Violations section not appearing
   - **Cause:** Conditional logic checked `value === false`, but all buttons had `value === true`
   - **Fix:** Removed conditional check, always collect violations
   
2. **Issue:** Two-step confirmation complexity
   - **Cause:** Original design required "Confirm Decision" button
   - **Fix:** Simplified to one-step: check violations → click decision

---

## Feature 2: Athlete Name Filtering

### Problem Statement
Users needed ability to filter Decision Results by specific athlete names to track individual athlete decisions and violations.

### Solution Implemented
Added a fourth filter dropdown for athlete names that populates based on selected competition.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Frontend (`app/templates/admin/referee_decisions.html`)

**Added athlete filter dropdown:**
```html
<div class="filter-group">
    <label for="athlete-select">Athlete Name</label>
    <select id="athlete-select" disabled>
        <option value="">All athletes...</option>
    </select>
</div>
```

**Updated grid layout:**
```css
.filter-row {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
}
```

**JavaScript updates:**
```javascript
class DecisionResults {
    constructor() {
        this.athleteSelect = document.getElementById('athlete-select');
        // ...
    }
    
    init() {
        this.athleteSelect.addEventListener('change', () => this.onFilterChange());
    }
    
    async onCompetitionChange() {
        // Populate athletes from API
        this.athleteSelect.innerHTML = '<option value="">All athletes</option>';
        if (data.athletes && data.athletes.length > 0) {
            data.athletes.forEach(athlete => {
                const option = document.createElement('option');
                option.value = athlete;
                option.textContent = athlete;
                this.athleteSelect.appendChild(option);
            });
        }
        this.athleteSelect.disabled = false;
    }
    
    async loadResults() {
        const athlete = this.athleteSelect.value;
        // ...
        if (athlete) url += `&athlete=${encodeURIComponent(athlete)}`;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Backend (`app/routes/admin.py`)

**Updated filters endpoint to return athletes:**
```python
@admin_bp.route('/api/decision-filters/<int:competition_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_decision_filters(competition_id):
    # Get unique athlete names
    athletes = db.session.query(RefereeDecisionLog.athlete_name)\
        .filter_by(competition_id=competition_id)\
        .filter(RefereeDecisionLog.athlete_name.isnot(None))\
        .distinct()\
        .order_by(RefereeDecisionLog.athlete_name)\
        .all()
    
    return jsonify({
        'success': True,
        'events': [e[0] for e in events if e[0]],
        'flights': [f[0] for f in flights if f[0]],
        'athletes': [a[0] for a in athletes if a[0]]  # NEW
    }), 200
```

**Updated results endpoint to filter by athlete:**
```python
@admin_bp.route('/api/decision-results', methods=['GET'])
def get_decision_results():
    athlete = request.args.get('athlete')  # NEW
    
    # ... query building ...
    
    if athlete:
        query = query.filter_by(athlete_name=athlete)  # NEW
```

### User Workflow
```
1. Select Competition → Loads athletes
2. Select Athlete (optional) → Filters by athlete
3. Combine with Event/Flight → Narrow down results
4. Click "Load Results" → See filtered decisions
```

### Filter Combinations
- Competition only
- Competition + Athlete
- Competition + Event + Athlete
- Competition + Flight + Athlete
- Competition + Event + Flight + Athlete

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Violations Feature
1. **All decision buttons have `value: true`** in database
   - This is a backend configuration issue
   - Workaround: Collect violations for all decisions, not just "No Lift"
   
2. **No validation on violation selection**
   - Multiple violations allowed (expected behavior)
   - Empty violations allowed (expected behavior)

### Athlete Filter Feature
1. **No search/autocomplete** for large athlete lists
   - Could be added for competitions with many athletes
   
2. **No multi-select** for comparing athletes
   - Single athlete selection only
