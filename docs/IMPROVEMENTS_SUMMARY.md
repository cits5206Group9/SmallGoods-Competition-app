- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  ./run_tests.sh                    # Run all tests
  ./run_tests.sh --coverage         # With coverage
  ./run_tests.sh --html             # Generate HTML report
  ./run_tests.sh --fail-under 70    # Enforce 70% coverage
  ```

#### B. Code Formatter Script (format_code.sh)

**Location**: `format_code.sh`

### 5. Updated .gitignore

**New Entries**:
```
# Coverage reports
htmlcov/
.coverage
.coverage.*
coverage.json
coverage.xml
*.cover
.hypothesis/
```

Ensures coverage reports are not committed to version control.

---

## Package Installation

**Installed**:
- `pytest-cov` - Coverage plugin for pytest

This was added to enable coverage testing functionality.

---

## Usage Examples

### Run Tests

```bash
# Simple test run
pytest

# With coverage
./run_tests.sh --coverage

# Generate HTML coverage report
./run_tests.sh --html

# View report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Format Code

```bash
# Format everything
./format_code.sh

# Check formatting (for CI/CD)
./format_code.sh --check

# Individual tools
isort .
black .
ruff check --fix .
```

### Pre-Commit Workflow

```bash
# 1. Format code
./format_code.sh

# 2. Run tests with coverage
./run_tests.sh --coverage

# 3. Review coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html

# 4. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

3. ✅ Run initial coverage report: `./run_tests.sh --html`
4. ✅ Review coverage gaps in HTML report

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Add tests for critical routes (`app/routes/admin.py`, `app/routes/athlete.py`)
2. Add tests for scoring logic (`app/utils/scoring.py`)
3. Increase coverage to 40%+
4. Set up pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
1. Add integration tests for complete workflows
2. Add tests for WebSocket events
3. Increase coverage to 60%+
4. Add coverage reporting to CI/CD

### Long-term (3-6 months)
1. Achieve 80%+ overall coverage
2. Maintain 90%+ coverage for critical modules
3. Automated coverage trend tracking
4. Coverage badges in README
