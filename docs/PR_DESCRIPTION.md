# 🎯 Feature: Timekeeper Enhancements - Next Athlete, Order Management, Break Timers & Edit Buttons

## Summary
This PR implements a comprehensive set of enhancements to the Timekeeper page, improving workflow efficiency and user experience:

1. **Next Athlete Button**: Added "Next" button that automatically loads the next athlete and attempt in the correct order from the flights management sequence, eliminating manual selection and reducing errors.

2. **Attempt Order Management**: Integrated the same drag-and-drop ordering system from the flights management page, allowing timekeepers to view, filter, sort, and reorder attempts directly from the timer page with real-time synchronization.

3. **Break Timer System**: Removed the old rest/break timer feature and replaced it with an automatic Flight/Event break timer that:
   - Auto-triggers when all attempts in a flight are finished
   - Uses configurable break times from the database (flight: 180s, event: 300s)
   - Shows on competition load with manual controls available

4. **Edit Buttons for All Timers**: Added edit functionality to Attempt Timer, Break Timer, and Pinned Rest Timers, allowing on-the-fly time adjustments without stopping timers.

These changes streamline the timekeeper workflow by reducing manual steps, improving attempt ordering visibility, and providing better control over all timing functions.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`app/templates/admin/timer.html`**
   - Added Edit button HTML for Attempt Timer
   - Added Edit button and edit row for Break Timer
   - Updated Break Timer card structure with inline editor

2. **`app/static/js/timekeeper.js`**
   - Added `btnAttemptEdit` handler with show/hide logic
   - Added `btnBreakEdit` handler with inline editor toggle
   - Modified `renderPin()` to include Edit button for rest timers

### Key Functions Added/Modified
```javascript
// Attempt Timer Edit
btnAttemptEdit.onclick = () => {
  // Toggle visibility, pre-fill current time
}

// Break Timer Edit  
btnBreakEdit.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Show/hide inline editor, update subtext on apply
}

// Load competition and show break timer
loadCompetitionBreakTimerData(competitionId)

// Rest Timer Edit (in renderPin)
btnEdit.onclick = () => {
  // Toggle set row visibility
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Consistent Design**: All edit buttons use pencil icon (✎) for visual consistency

- **Informative Display**: Break timer shows custom time label after editing

## 🧪 Testing Performed
