## How to View Coverage Reports

### Option 1: HTML Report (Recommended)

The HTML coverage report provides an interactive, color-coded view of your code coverage:

```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
./run_tests.sh --html

# Open the report in your browser
open htmlcov/index.html       # macOS
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html   # Linux  
start htmlcov/index.html      # Windows
```

**What you'll see:**
- **Green**: Covered code (executed during tests)
- **Red**: Uncovered code (not executed)
- **Yellow**: Partially covered (some branches not tested)
- Click on any file to see line-by-line coverage

### Option 2: Terminal Report

For quick checks without opening a browser:

```bash
# Run with coverage in terminal
./run_tests.sh --coverage
```

This shows:
```
Name                              Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------------------
app/models.py                       246     10    96%   150-153, 194
app/extensions.py                     6      0   100%
---------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                              3698   2815    24%
```

### Option 3: JSON Report

For programmatic access or CI/CD integration:

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=json
```

This creates `coverage.json` with detailed coverage data.

- ⚠️ `app/config.py` - 86%
- ⚠️ `app/routes/coach.py` - 73%

### Needs Improvement (<70%)
- ❌ `app/routes/admin.py` - 12% (Priority: HIGH)
- ❌ `app/routes/athlete.py` - 8% (Priority: HIGH)
- ❌ `app/utils/scoring.py` - 16% (Priority: HIGH)
- ❌ `app/real_time/websocket.py` - 38%
- ❌ `app/real_time/event_handlers.py` - 36%

## Quick Commands

### Running Tests

```bash
# Simple test run
pytest

# Or use the helper script
./run_tests.sh

# With coverage
./run_tests.sh --coverage

# Generate HTML report
./run_tests.sh --html

# Verbose output
./run_tests.sh --verbose

# Run specific tests
./run_tests.sh --test tests/test_models.py

# Enforce coverage threshold
./run_tests.sh --coverage --fail-under 70
```

### Formatting Code

```bash
# Format all code
./format_code.sh

# Check only (don't modify)
./format_code.sh --check

# Individual tools
isort .                    # Sort imports
black .                    # Format code
ruff check --fix .         # Lint and fix
```

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Format code
./format_code.sh

# 2. Run tests with coverage
./run_tests.sh --html

# 3. View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html

# 4. If all good, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

## Understanding the HTML Coverage Report

### Main Page (index.html)

Shows overall statistics:
- **Total coverage percentage**
- **List of all modules** with their individual coverage
- **Sortable columns** (click headers to sort)

### File View

Click on any file to see:
- **Line numbers** with coverage indicators
- **Green background**: Line was executed
- **Red background**: Line was not executed
- **Yellow background**: Partial branch coverage
- **Right column**: Shows number of times each line was executed

### Example:

```python
1  def calculate_score(weight, attempts):        # Green (covered)
2      if weight > 100:                          # Yellow (partial - only True tested)
3          return weight * 2                     # Green (covered)
4      else:
5          return weight                         # Red (not covered)
```

This tells you:
- Line 1, 3 are tested ✅
- Line 2 needs both True and False cases tested ⚠️
- Line 5 is never executed - need test for weight ≤ 100 ❌

## Database Connection Fixes

The unclosed database connection warnings have been addressed by:

1. **Updated `tests/conftest.py`**:
   - Added `db.engine.dispose()` to properly close connections
   - Added SQLAlchemy engine options for better connection management

2. **Updated `pytest.ini`**:
   - Added ResourceWarning filter to suppress coverage tool warnings

The remaining warnings are from the coverage tool itself during AST parsing and are benign.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review HTML coverage report**:
   ```bash
   open htmlcov/index.html
   ```

2. **Focus on high-priority modules**:
   - Add tests for `app/routes/admin.py`
   - Add tests for `app/routes/athlete.py`
   - Add tests for `app/utils/scoring.py`

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)

- Increase coverage to 40%+
- Add API endpoint tests
- Add scoring calculation tests
- Document test patterns

### Long-term Goals (1-3 months)

- Achieve 70%+ overall coverage
- Maintain 90%+ for critical modules
- Integrate coverage into CI/CD
- Add coverage badges to README

## Troubleshooting

### "Coverage HTML not generated"

**Solution**: Run with `--html` flag:
```bash
./run_tests.sh --html
```

### "Cannot find htmlcov directory"

**Solution**: The directory is only created when using `--html`:
```bash
./run_tests.sh --html
ls htmlcov/  # Should see index.html
```

### "Tests pass but coverage is low"

**Explanation**: This is expected. Current tests focus on:
- Module imports
- Basic initialization
- System integration

Most route handlers and business logic are not yet tested.

**Action**: Add more tests focusing on:
1. API endpoints
2. Business logic functions
3. Error handling
4. Edge cases
