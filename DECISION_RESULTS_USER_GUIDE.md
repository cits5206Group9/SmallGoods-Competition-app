## How Decisions Are Stored

### Automatic Storage
Every time a referee casts a decision on their individual referee page:

1. The decision is automatically saved to the database
2. All athlete and competition context is captured
3. The decision includes:
   - Who made it (referee)
   - When it was made (timestamp)
   - What was being judged (athlete, lift, attempt, weight)
   - The decision result (good lift, no lift, etc.)

### Data Captured
The system automatically captures:
- Current athlete's name from the timer
- Competition, event, and flight information
- Attempt number and weight
- Lift type (Snatch, Clean & Jerk, etc.)
- Athlete's weight class and team
- Referee details and position
- Exact timestamp of decision

## Integration with Existing Features

### Timer Integration
The decision storage system integrates with the timekeeper timer:
- Reads current athlete information from timer state
- Captures attempt details in real-time
- Ensures accurate context for every decision

### Referee Pages
No changes needed for referees:
- Referees continue using their individual pages normally
- Decisions are automatically saved in the background
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Shown

- **Try**: Select a different competition or remove event/flight filters
- **Verify**: Referees are using their pages and making decisions

### Filters Not Populating
- **Check**: Is a competition selected?
- **Verify**: Does the competition have decisions recorded?
- **Try**: Refresh the page and try again

### Missing Information in Results
- **Timer State**: Ensure the timekeeper has set up athlete information
