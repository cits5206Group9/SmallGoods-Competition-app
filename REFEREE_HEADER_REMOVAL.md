# Referee Header Navigation Removal

## Overview
Removed all navigation buttons from the header on referee-specific pages to prevent referees from accessing other admin areas when given direct links.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Base Template for Referees
**File:** `app/templates/base_referee.html`
- Created a new minimal base template without navigation buttons
- Includes only:
  - Basic HTML structure
  - Logo and branding (non-clickable)
  - Footer
  - No Dashboard, Display, or Account navigation buttons
  - No admin menu dropdown

### 2. Updated Referee Login Page
**File:** `app/templates/admin/referee_login.html`
- Changed from `{% extends "base.html" %}` to `{% extends "base_referee.html" %}`
- Now uses the clean header without navigation

### 3. Updated Individual Referee Panel
**File:** `app/templates/admin/individual_referee.html`
- Changed from `{% extends "base.html" %}` to `{% extends "base_referee.html" %}`
- Now uses the clean header without navigation

## Benefits

✅ **Security Enhancement**
- Referees cannot navigate to admin dashboard
- Referees cannot access display settings
- Referees cannot access account management

✅ **User Experience**
- Cleaner interface for referees
- Focuses referee attention on their decision panel
- Prevents confusion with unnecessary navigation options

✅ **Access Control**
- Direct links work as intended (e.g., `/admin/referee/login/1` or `/admin/referee/individual/1`)
- Referees stay within their designated area
- No accidental navigation to unauthorized pages

## How It Works

When a referee visits:
- **Login page** (`/admin/referee/login`) - Only sees logo, no navigation
- **Individual panel** (`/admin/referee/individual/<id>`) - Only sees logo, no navigation

Admin users visiting other pages still see full navigation through `base.html`.

## Testing

To verify:
1. Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/referee/login`
2. Observe: Only logo in header, no Dashboard/Display/Account buttons
3. Login as a referee
4. Observe: Individual referee panel also has clean header
